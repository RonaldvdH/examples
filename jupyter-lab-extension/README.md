# Example Jupyter Lab Extension

## Development
Run the following commands to start developing:
```bash
npm run dev
```

And in a new terminal (but still in the directory where this extension lives):
```bash
jupyter labextension link .
jupyter lab --watch
```

The extension will automatically compile every time you make a change to the code. Refresh your browser to see the results.
